# Reranking-Context-Optimization
This project explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for chess, testing retrieval, reranking, and compression to improve efficiency and accuracy.   The results show how design choices like top_k, reranking, and token compression affect cost, speed, and reliability when teaching LLMs about chess.
